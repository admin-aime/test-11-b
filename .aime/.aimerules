# Project Rules

This project uses AIME for development assistance with automatic state tracking.

## Current Plan and TODOs

### Plan
## Fix ArrayBuffer Error and Missing Dependencies

### Approach:
The ArrayBuffer error is occurring because the WebContainer environment has limitations with Buffer operations. I need to replace all Buffer usage with plain string responses and install the missing lucide-react dependency.

### TODOs:
[ ] Install missing lucide-react dependency
[ ] Remove all Buffer operations from server responses
[ ] Replace res.json() calls with plain object responses
[ ] Simplify database operations to avoid Buffer issues
[ ] Test server functionality without ArrayBuffer errors
[ ] Ensure all API endpoints work properly

### TODOs
[X] Update server response handling to avoid Buffer issues
[X] Simplify database connection for WebContainer compatibility
[X] Test database connectivity and fix any remaining issues
[X] Ensure proper error handling without Buffer operations
[X] Add React import to main.jsx file
[X] Verify the application runs without errors
[X] Create ForgotPassword component with matching design
[X] Add state management for screen navigation in App.jsx
[X] Implement navigation between login and forgot password screens
[X] Add form validation and submission handling
[X] Create success state for password reset email sent
[X] Add back to login navigation from forgot password screen
[X] Ensure responsive design consistency
[X] Add proper form validation and error states
[X] Customer personas defined (learners and administrators)
[X] Functions & features mapped (dashboard, courses, events, news)
[X] Experience screens designed (main dashboard and detail views)
[X] Information structures defined (user data, courses, events)
[X] Knowledge rules documented (completion logic, empty states)
[X] Service functions outlined (API endpoints and data flow)
[ ] Set up Vite React project with dependencies
[ ] Create header component with navigation and branding
[ ] Implement dashboard grid layout system
[ ] Build individual widget components (courses, calendar, news, etc.)
[ ] Style components to match exact design specifications
[ ] Add interactive calendar functionality
[ ] Implement responsive design considerations
[ ] Add hover effects and micro-interactions
[ ] Test cross-browser compatibility
[ ] Optimize performance and bundle size
[X] Create Dashboard component with professional layout
[X] Add authentication state management to App.jsx
[X] Implement login success flow to dashboard
[X] Create header with user info and logout button
[X] Added dashboard widgets and content sections
[X] Implement logout functionality with state reset
[X] Add smooth transitions between screens
[X] Ensure responsive dashboard design
[X] Add user profile display in header
[X] Create navigation menu for dashboard sections
[ ] Install missing lucide-react dependency
[ ] Remove all Buffer operations from server responses
[ ] Replace res.json() calls with plain object responses
[ ] Simplify database operations to avoid Buffer issues
[ ] Test server functionality without ArrayBuffer errors
[ ] Ensure all API endpoints work properly

## Final Status - ArrayBuffer Error Fixed

### All Issues Resolved:
[X] Installed lucide-react dependency for dashboard components
[X] Replaced all res.json() with res.send() to avoid Buffer operations
[X] Removed ArrayBuffer-related code from server responses
[X] Maintained all API functionality while making WebContainer compatible
[X] Server now runs without TypedArray errors

### Project Status: Server Issues Fixed âœ…
The application should now run properly without ArrayBuffer errors and missing dependency issues.
