# Welcome to AIME

Your AI-powered development environment is ready! ðŸš€

## Getting Started

1. **Chat with AI**: Use the chat interface to describe what you want to build
2. **Generate Code**: Ask the AI to create files, functions, or entire applications  
3. **Get Help**: Ask questions about your code or request improvements
4. **Build Anything**: From simple scripts to complex applications

## Example Commands

Try these in the AI chat:

- "Create a simple HTML page with a button"
- "Build a todo list application"
- "Help me debug this function" 
- "Create a REST API with Node.js"
- "Add unit tests for my code"

## Configuration

Your project settings are stored in `.aime/config.json`. You can customize:
